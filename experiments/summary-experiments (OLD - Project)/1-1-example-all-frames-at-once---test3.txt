Input:
- Four Input Images
- test.txt with prompt (what can you see on the pictures?)


Output:
 The images you provided appear to be visualizations of intensity and phase data for different frequencies. Here is a detailed summary of each pair of images:

1. **First Pair (Frequency 0001/1400):**
   - **Intensity Plot:**
     - The intensity plot shows a mostly uniform, dark purple color, indicating very low intensity values across the spatial units on both the X-axis and Y-axis.
   - **Phase Plot:**
     - The phase plot shows a mix of colors, predominantly red and blue, indicating varying phase values. There is a noticeable pattern or structure in the phase data, with some areas showing more concentrated phase changes.

2. **Second Pair (Frequency 0002/1400):**
   - **Intensity Plot:**
     - Similar to the first pair, the intensity plot is mostly dark purple, indicating low intensity values.
   - **Phase Plot:**
     - The phase plot shows more distinct structures compared to the first pair. There are clear regions with different phase values, including a prominent rectangular area with a mix of red and blue phases.

3. **Third Pair (Frequency 0003/1400):**
   - **Intensity Plot:**
     - The intensity plot remains mostly dark purple, indicating low intensity values.
   - **Phase Plot:**
     - The phase plot shows two distinct regions with different phase values. There is a central area with a mix of red and blue phases, surrounded by a more uniform background.

4. **Fourth Pair (Frequency 0004/1400):**
   - **Intensity Plot:**
     - The intensity plot is again mostly dark purple, indicating low intensity values.
   - **Phase Plot:**
     - The phase plot shows a prominent rectangular area with a mix of red and blue phases, similar to the second pair but with more defined boundaries.

### General Observations:
- **Intensity:** Across all frequencies, the intensity plots are uniformly low, indicating that the primary focus of these visualizations is on the phase information rather than the intensity.
- **Phase:** The phase plots show varying structures and patterns, with distinct regions of different phase values. These patterns become more pronounced and structured as the frequency increases from 0001 to 0004.

### Possible Interpretations:
- These visualizations could be related to wave propagation, interference patterns, or other phenomena where phase information is crucial.
- The rectangular patterns in the phase plots might indicate regions of interest or specific structures within the data.

If you have more context or specific questions about these visualizations, please provide additional details so I can offer more targeted information.
