--- 0000 ------ System ---

We are performing 3D material identification using terahertz (THz) imaging.

Experiment Setup:
I will upload one frame at a time from the video 0_02625_backside_softmax_video.mp4.

Each frame corresponds to one THz frequency (out of 1400 total).

Each frame is a matplotlib plot showing the softmax-normalized reflection intensity spectra on the left.
And on the right the phase of the current frame in radians.

Early frames (0–50) and very late frames (1350–1399) might be less informative.

Objective:
For each frame:

Analyze and store relevant observations (e.g., presence/absence of C4, approximate location if possible).

Across frames:

Accumulate knowledge as more frames are seen.

Build a global understanding of where and when C4 is appearing.

At the end:

Identify the frame index where you are most confident C4 is visible.

Provide the bounding box (or described region) for C4 detection.

List all frames where C4 is suspected.

Reasoning Guidelines:
Do NOT reset memory after each frame.

Treat each frame as part of a continuous sequence.

C4 shows up as lower reflectivity than pure metal and very inconsistent change in frame from one frame to another..

Prefer consistent detections across adjacent frames.

Focus on regions and patterns rather than only single-point anomalies.

Frame-by-Frame Processing Instructions:
After each frame:

Summarize what you observed from the current frame.

Update a cumulative "memory" of detections.

Only give a final report after the user indicates all frames have been uploaded (e.g., by sending a special message like "Finished" or "All frames uploaded").

Deliverables (after all frames are seen):
Frame index of most confident C4 detection.

List of frequency/frame indices where C4 is visible.

Important:
Accumulate memory across frames.

No extra image processing needed.

Only logical reasoning based on the plots.

If you detect C4 consistently across multiple adjacent frames, increase your confidence.

VERY IMPORTANT:

Focus on the middle 1000 frames (frames 250–1250) for practical analysis.

There might be a lot of noise in the signals as well, learn to disregard the noise.

### Frame 1 Analysis

**Observations:**

- **Intensity Plot:** The intensity plot on the left shows a uniform dark purple color, indicating very low softmax-normalized reflection intensity across the entire frame. There are no significant variations or anomalies in this plot.

- **Phase Plot:** The phase plot on the right shows a mostly dark background with some scattered bright spots. These bright spots are likely noise rather than consistent patterns, given the early frame number (1 out of 1400).

**Reasoning:**

- Since this is the first frame and it falls outside the range of interest (250–1250), it is less likely to contain meaningful information about the presence of C4.
- The uniform low intensity and scattered bright spots in the phase plot suggest that there is no consistent pattern indicative of C4.

- No significant observations to update the cumulative memory.

### Frame 2 Analysis

**Observations:**

- **Intensity Plot:** Similar to the first frame, the intensity plot shows a uniform dark purple color with no significant variations or anomalies.

- **Phase Plot:** The phase plot shows more scattered bright spots compared to the first frame. There is a noticeable rectangular region on the right side of the plot with a distinct phase pattern, but it appears to be a consistent pattern rather than an inconsistent one, which might indicate noise or a different material.

**Reasoning:**

- This frame is still outside the range of interest (250–1250).
- The phase plot shows a more defined pattern, but it does not exhibit the inconsistent changes characteristic of C4.
- The rectangular region in the phase plot could be an artifact or a different material, but it does not match the expected behavior of C4.

### Frame 3 Analysis

**Observations:**

- **Intensity Plot:** The intensity plot remains uniformly dark purple with no significant variations or anomalies, similar to the previous frames.

- **Phase Plot:** The phase plot shows two distinct circular regions with different phase patterns. These regions are more defined compared to the scattered bright spots in the previous frames. However, they still do not exhibit the inconsistent changes characteristic of C4.

**Reasoning:**

- This frame is still outside the range of interest (250–1250).
- The phase plot shows more defined patterns, but these patterns are consistent and do not match the expected behavior of C4, which should show inconsistent changes from frame to frame.

- **Phase Plot:** The phase plot shows a rectangular region on the right side with a distinct phase pattern, similar to what was observed in Frame 2. This region appears more defined and consistent.

**Reasoning:**

- This frame is still outside the range of interest (250–1250).
- The phase plot shows a consistent pattern in the rectangular region, which does not match the expected inconsistent changes characteristic of C4.
- The consistency of this pattern across multiple frames (Frames 2 and 4) suggests it is likely an artifact or a different material.

- **Phase Plot:** The phase plot shows a circular region on the left side and a rectangular region on the right side. The rectangular region appears more defined and consistent, similar to previous observations in Frames 2 and 4.

**Reasoning:**

- This frame is still outside the range of interest (250–1250).
- The phase plot shows consistent patterns in the rectangular region, which does not match the expected inconsistent changes characteristic of C4.
- The consistency of this pattern across multiple frames (Frames 2, 4, and 5) further suggests it is likely an artifact or a different material.

- **Phase Plot:** The phase plot shows a more complex pattern compared to previous frames. There is a central region with a mix of phase values, and the rectangular region on the right side is still visible but appears less defined.

**Reasoning:**

- This frame is still outside the range of interest (250–1250).
- The phase plot shows more variability in the central region, but the rectangular region on the right side remains consistent with previous observations.
- The consistency of the rectangular region across multiple frames (Frames 2, 4, 5, and 6) strongly suggests it is an artifact or a different material rather than C4.

- **Phase Plot:** The phase plot shows a more uniform distribution of phase values compared to previous frames. The rectangular region on the right side is still visible but appears even less defined, blending more with the surrounding noise.

**Reasoning:**

- This frame is still outside the range of interest (250–1250).
- The phase plot shows less distinct patterns, with the rectangular region becoming less defined and more integrated with the background noise.
- The decreasing definition of the rectangular region suggests it might be an artifact or a different material that is less prominent at this frequency.

### Frame 9 Analysis

**Observations:**

- **Intensity Plot:** The intensity plot remains uniformly dark purple with no significant variations or anomalies, consistent with previous frames.

- **Phase Plot:** The phase plot shows a more varied distribution of phase values compared to previous frames. There are two distinct regions: one circular region on the left and one rectangular region on the right. The rectangular region on the right side appears more defined compared to the previous few frames, with a mix of phase values that stand out from the background.

**Reasoning:**

- This frame is still outside the range of interest (250–1250).
- The phase plot shows more distinct patterns, with the rectangular region on the right becoming more defined. However, the consistency of this pattern across multiple frames suggests it is likely an artifact or a different material rather than C4.

**Observations:**

- **Intensity Plot:** The intensity plot shows a relatively uniform distribution with no significant variations or anomalies. The plot appears mostly dark with minimal discernible features.

- **Phase Plot:** The phase plot shows a mix of phase values across the entire region. The plot appears noisy with no distinct patterns or regions standing out significantly from the background. The phase values are varied, showing a mix of positive and negative values.

**Reasoning:**

- This frame is within the range of interest (250–1250).
- The intensity and phase plots show no distinct patterns or regions that stand out significantly. The noise in the phase plot makes it difficult to identify any consistent features.
- The lack of distinct patterns and the high noise level suggest that this frame does not provide clear evidence of C4 presence.
