 Sending the next Image now. Analyse it and answer with reasoning. Here is the Image Nr. 1
Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:2 for open-end generation.


---output--- 1

 ### Frame Number 1
### Observation: No C4
The image shows a very uniform and low-intensity region in the intensity plot, with no significant features or variations. The phase plot also shows a relatively uniform distribution with no distinct patterns or discontinuities that would indicate the presence of C4. The lack of variation in both intensity and phase suggests that this frame does not provide evidence of C4.
### Memory Update: No significant changes detected.

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:2 for open-end generation.


---output--- 2

 ### Frame Number 2
### Observation: No C4
The intensity plot remains uniform and low, similar to the previous frame, with no significant features or variations. The phase plot shows some noise and slight variations, but there are no distinct patterns or discontinuities that would indicate the presence of C4. The overall uniformity in the intensity plot and the lack of clear phase changes suggest that this frame does not provide evidence of C4.
### Memory Update: No significant changes detected.

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:2 for open-end generation.


---output--- 3

 ### Frame Number 3
### Observation: No C4
The intensity plot continues to show a uniform and low-intensity region with no significant features or variations. The phase plot exhibits some noise and slight variations, but there are no distinct patterns or discontinuities that would suggest the presence of C4. The overall uniformity in the intensity plot and the lack of clear phase changes indicate that this frame does not provide evidence of C4.
### Memory Update: No significant changes detected.
