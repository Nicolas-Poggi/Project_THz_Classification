- Goal 
Identify the presence of C4 explosive material by analyzing a sequence of 1400 terahertz (THz) imaging plots. Each image represents a frequency-specific intensity and phase profile across depth. Determine which frequencies (images) and regions most confidently indicate the presence of C4, based on differences in intensity and phase behavior between metal-only and metal+C4 regions. Use the "Context Dump" Section as a reference for understanding the given THz images and how to be classifying them. 
 
In the following prompts I will send each Terahertz image one at a time in the described format (See Prompt Format-Each Image). Please Analyse each Image and Classify it based on <Return Format Each Image> and <Warnings>. The output of the prompt should not repeat the instructions back to me. It should only give a brief answer ("Yes C4" or "No C4") and answer with reasoning why this is the case.After Sending the last prompt (Nr. 1400) and receiving the "<END OF Terahertz Images>" Tag, please output the findings based on the < FINAL Return Format > and <Warnings>.

- Context Dump 
Terahertz (THz) images are captured using electromagnetic waves in the terahertz band (roughly 0.1‚Äì10 THz). In practice, a THz imaging system illuminates the object with THz radiation and records the reflected or transmitted signal. Commonly, coherent pulsed THz systems (THz time-domain spectroscopy) are used: an ultrafast laser generates short THz pulses, and a detector measures the time-domain waveform. This yields both amplitude (intensity) and phase information at each pixel, allowing reconstruction of 2D images or tomographic 3D slices. THz imaging is non-ionizing and can see through many non-metallic materials, providing contrast based on dielectric properties. 
 
In our THz images, intensity refers to the power of the detected terahertz (THz) field at each pixel location. It is computed as the square of the magnitude of the complex THz field, reflecting the energy content at that point in space. Before visualization, the raw complex-valued data is preprocessed to ensure consistent orientation and structure. This includes operations such as magnitude calculation, squaring, and coordinate correction. To enhance contrast and interpretability, the intensity values are then scaled using softmax normalization, which maps them into a relative range‚Äîtypically [0, 1]‚Äîbased on their exponential distribution. The final intensity is expressed in arbitrary units, representing relative differences in THz power absorption or reflection. When interpreting intensity, brighter (higher intensity) regions generally correspond to areas where more THz power is transmitted or reflected, indicating lower absorption by the material. Conversely, darker (lower intensity) regions suggest higher absorption or scattering, which may indicate structural boundaries, material differences, or hidden features. The intensity map thus serves as a spatial representation of the material's electromagnetic response to THz radiation. 
 
Phase in THz imaging refers to the angle of the complex electromagnetic wave at each pixel in the image. It indicates the timing or delay of the wave as it propagates through or reflects off the sample. To calculate the phase, the raw data is first processed by applying a windowing function to the complex field data, followed by a Fourier Transform to shift the frequency domain. The phase is then extracted from the complex field at a specific depth, representing the temporal shift or time delay at each point in the sample. When interpreting the phase image, shifts in phase can reveal variations in material properties, such as the refractive index and thickness of the sample. Phase contrast highlights subtle structural details that might not be visible in the intensity image, making it useful for identifying internal material differences or features hidden beneath the surface. 
 
The THz images were acquired using a reflection-mode Terahertz Time-Domain Imaging (THz-TDI) setup with a single transmitter and receiver. A 2D raster scan was performed across the sample surface, capturing time-resolved THz signals at each (x, y) position. A lens was used to focus the THz beam, and the time-domain data were converted into depth-resolved images via a Fourier Transform (FFT), enabling the formation of a 3D image volume. The scanning produced 1400 depth samples (z-axis) per lateral position, providing fine resolution along depth. The lateral sampling resolution was 0.2625 mm, which is considered high and allows for detailed spatial mapping. 
 
WHAT TO EXPECT 
In Terahertz (THz) imaging, both geometry and material response influence the output. The dataset includes two distinct target types: (1) A metal plate (2) A metal-coated object, possibly containing C4 explosive material underneath. 
These are visualized through two types of images per depth layer: (1) Intensity images (with colormap viridis), showing reflected signal strength normalized via softmax to the range [0, 1]. (2) Phase images (with colormap twilight), showing the wave propagation delay from -œÄ to œÄ radians. 
One frame alone cannot give one this information.  
It is essential for reasonable deduction to consider change in intensity and phase across multiple frames as the depth increases and frequencies change. 
Expected Observations: 
1.	Metal  
Intensity (viridis): 
The metal plate should appear as a bright region with fairly uniform intensity due to strong, flat-surface reflection. Edges may appear slightly brighter due to specular highlights or slight angle differences. This observation should remain more-or-less consistent across depth frames as frequencies change. 
Phase (twilight): 
The phase map should reveal clear boundaries of the metal, possibly forming sharp phase discontinuities at boundaries. Inside the metallic region, the phase may be relatively uniform or show subtle gradients depending on plate thickness or surface tilt. This observation should remain more-or-less consistent across depth frames as frequencies change. 
 
2. C4 
Intensity (viridis): 
This object should have non-uniform reflections that stand out from the background. One giveaway would be substantial changes in intensities from one frame to another. 
 
Phase (twilight): 
This object should have non-uniform reflections that stand out from the background. One giveaway would be substantial changes in intensities from one frame to another. 
 
Please note that the C4 might be inside metallic covering and thus the region that contains C4 might sometimes mimic the expected properties of metal, especially in the initial and the last frames from the 1400 frames.  
 
DESCRIBE IMAGES (Intensity & Phase) 
Each Terahertz image represents a 2D scan at a specific frequency, indicated at the top of the image. The image is divided into two main components: 
Left Panel ‚Äì Intensity: Displays the normalized reflection intensity of the signal, using the viridis colormap. The values are softmax-normalized and scaled to the range [0,1], highlighting relative signal strength across the scanned area. 
Right Panel ‚Äì Phase: Shows the phase information of the reflected wave, using the twilight colormap. Values range from [-ùúã,ùúã] radians, representing the wave propagation delay, which is sensitive to material properties and geometric features. 
Each panel includes X and Y axes that indicate the spatial dimensions of the scan, allowing for interpretation of physical positioning within the imaged area.
