We are performing 3D material identification using terahertz (THz) imaging.

Experiment Setup:
I will upload one frame at a time from the video 0_02625_backside_softmax_video.mp4.

Each frame corresponds to one THz frequency (out of 1400 total).

Each frame is a matplotlib plot showing the softmax-normalized reflection intensity spectra on the left.
And on the right the phase of the current frame in radians.

Early frames (0–50) and very late frames (1350–1399) might be less informative.

Objective:
For each frame:

Analyze and store relevant observations (e.g., presence/absence of C4, approximate location if possible).

Across frames:

Accumulate knowledge as more frames are seen.

Build a global understanding of where and when C4 is appearing.

At the end:

Identify the frame index where you are most confident C4 is visible.

Provide the bounding box (or described region) for C4 detection.

List all frames where C4 is suspected.

Reasoning Guidelines:
Do NOT reset memory after each frame.

Treat each frame as part of a continuous sequence.

C4 shows up as lower reflectivity than pure metal and very inconsistent change in frame from one frame to another..

Prefer consistent detections across adjacent frames.

Focus on regions and patterns rather than only single-point anomalies.

Frame-by-Frame Processing Instructions:
After each frame:

Summarize what you observed from the current frame.

Update a cumulative "memory" of detections.

Only give a final report after the user indicates all frames have been uploaded (e.g., by sending a special message like "Finished" or "All frames uploaded").

Deliverables (after all frames are seen):
Frame index of most confident C4 detection.

List of frequency/frame indices where C4 is visible.

Important:
Accumulate memory across frames.

No extra image processing needed.

Only logical reasoning based on the plots.

If you detect C4 consistently across multiple adjacent frames, increase your confidence.

VERY IMPORTANT:

Focus on the middle 1000 frames (frames 250–1250) for practical analysis.

There might be a lot of noise in the signals as well, learn to disregard the noise.
